            <p>Subhas Chandra Bose, affectionately known as Netaji, was a prominent figure in India's struggle for independence. Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, he was the ninth child of Janakinath Bose, a successful lawyer, and Prabhabati Devi. Bose's early education was marked by excellence; he graduated with a degree in philosophy from the University of Calcutta. His exposure to the writings of Swami Vivekananda deeply influenced his nationalist fervor.</p>
            <p>In 1920, Bose qualified for the Indian Civil Services in England but resigned, driven by a desire to actively participate in India's liberation movement. Upon returning to India, he joined the Indian National Congress and became a protégé of Chittaranjan Das, a prominent nationalist leader. Bose's leadership skills soon became evident, and he was elected as the President of the Congress in 1938. However, ideological differences with Mahatma Gandhi, particularly regarding the use of force in the struggle for independence, led to his resignation in 1939. He subsequently founded the Forward Bloc, aiming to consolidate the political left.</p>

                During World War II, Bose sought international support to overthrow British rule. He traveled to Germany and later to Japan, where he assumed leadership of the Indian National Army (INA), composed of Indian prisoners of war and expatriates. Under his command, the INA launched a military campaign against British forces in India. Despite initial successes, the campaign faced setbacks, and with Japan's surrender in 1945, the INA disbanded.

                Bose's death remains a subject of debate. It is widely believed that he died in a plane crash in Taiwan on August 18, 1945, though various theories have since emerged. His legacy endures, with numerous institutions, including the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport in Kolkata, named in his honor. His unwavering commitment to India's freedom continues to inspire generations.
